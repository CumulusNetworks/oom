This is all the source code to run the Jan 13, 2016 demo of OOM

Checkout these files into a clean directory
run 'make'

py oomdemo.py   # runs the demo
oomsouth_driver.exe     # runs C code to exercise the Southbound shim

The build process assumes your C compiler builds libraries that your 
Python interpereter can run!

Note in the makefile the process to create the module_data directory and
populate it with data with the correct names.  Substitute different 
source files, or give these different numbers in the first character
to populate different ports with different data.  Note that port 3 is 
hardwired for now to CFP, with limited support.
